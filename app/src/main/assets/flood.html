    <h2>What is a Flood?</h2>
    <p>Flood is caused by rainwater accumulation from drainage as well as overflowing streams and other bodies of water. Floods can seriously harm both people and property.</p>

    <h3>Pre-Flood Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Avoid constructing your home along rivers or floodplains.</li>
        <li>Keep debris from building up in drainage areas.</li>
        <li>Make sure the drainage systems are operating properly.</li>
        <li>To reduce floods, plant trees and preserve the forests, especially in the mountains.</li>
        <li>Protect the rivers. Throwing trash will cause them to become shallow, which will eliminate their ability to drain.</li>
        <li>Septic tanks shouldn't be connected to rivers or drainage canals.</li>
        <li>Riverbeds require regular desilting, dredging, widening, and deepening.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Before:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep up with PAGASA's daily weather forecasts and conditions.</li>
        <li>Know how frequently and how much your location is likely to flood.</li>
        <li>Make sure your family is aware of your community's flood warning system and evacuation procedure.</li>
        <li>Decide on a location where the family and livestock can evacuate.</li>
        <li>Family members should be given specific tasks and responsibilities in accordance with an evacuation plan.</li>
        <li>Keep a supply of food that lasts for at least three days and needs little to no cooking or refrigeration.</li>
        <li>In case of an emergency, keep cell phones, emergency cooking supplies, candles, matches, and a first aid kit close at hand.</li>
        <li>Securely anchor flimsy buildings.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>When Warned of Flood:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beware of flood waters that are rising quickly.</li>
        <li>In case of an emergency, keep an eye on your radio for any possible evacuation orders or instructions.</li>
        <li>Water service interruptions may occur, so keep drinking water in containers.</li>
        <li>Place household items in higher levels.</li>
        <li>Move livestock to a higher location.</li>
        <li>Evacuate if instructed to do so.. Donâ€˜t panic. Before floodwaters block access, move to a safe location.</li>
        <li>Switch off the gas valve and main electrical switch. Unplug all electrical devices. If you are damp or standing in water, avoid touching electrical equipment. Before evacuating, lock up your home.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>During:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stay indoors.</li>
        <li>If the water is above your knees in rivers or streams, do not try to cross them. </li>
        <li>Avoid using boats or swimming in swollen rivers./li>
        <li>Driving through flooded areas or streets is not advised. Make no unnecessary trips.</li>
        <li>Stay away from any downed power lines.</li>
        <li>Watch out for gas leaks. By using a flashlight, scan the area for damage.</li>
        <li>Inform the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils of any flooded areas.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>After:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a flashlight, not lanterns or torches, to cautiously re-enter your home. There may be flammables and dangerous creatures inside, like snakes.</li>
        <li>Watch out for fire hazards like frayed electrical cords.</li>
        <li>Eat nothing and drink nothing until it has been inspected for contamination.</li>
        <li>Contact the appropriate agencies or authorities to report any damaged utility lines (electricity, water, gas, and telephone).</li>
        <li>Avoid using any appliances or other equipment, do not turn on the main switch. Also, have a qualified electrician inspect the equipment.</li>
        <li>For information on immunization requirements, consult the appropriate health authorities.</li>
        <li>In disaster zones, avoid going "sightseeing." Your presence could make rescue and other emergency situations more difficult.</li>
    </ol>

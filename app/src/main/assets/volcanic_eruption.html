    <h2>What is a Volcanic Eruption?</h2>
    <p>A volcanic eruption occurs when volcanoes spew hot, dangerous gasses, ash, lava, and rock that are powerfully destructive on the Earth’s surface. Health risks from volcanic eruptions include floods, mudslides, power outages, contaminated drinking water, and wildfires.</p>

    <h3>Preparedness Measures:</h3>
    <p>Knowing how and why volcanic hazards occur and the places most likely to be affected is the first step in protecting people, property, and investments from these risks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comply strictly with PHIVOLCS‘ prohibition against human settlement in permanent danger zones. Always be on alert and listen to advisories of not venturing into identified restricted areas during volcanic unrest.</li>
        <li>Identify, evaluate, and characterize areas vulnerable to hazards and implement appropriate land use plan and zonation.</li>
        <li>Heed warnings and evacuation orders in times of volcanic  unrest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to do before, during, and after a Volcanic Eruption</h3>

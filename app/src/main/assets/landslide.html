    <h2>What is a Landslide?</h2>
    <p>Landslide is the movement of a mass of rock, debris, earth, or soil down the slope due to prolonged heavy rainfall or earthquakes. Several factors may also contribute to landslides, including the high degree of weathering and fracturing of rocks, a steep configuration of slope, deforestation, and the overloading of slope surfaces following the construction of heavy structures.</p>

    <h3>What to do before, during, and after a Landslide</h3>
    <h3>Before:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Know if the area is at risk of landslides.</li>
        <li>To mitigate or prevent landslides, seek professional advice on the precautions that are best suited for the area.</li>
        <li>When necessary, reinforce a building's walls and foundation. </li>
        <li>Ensure those site developments are compatible with the conditions and constraints of the natural environment by creating a land use plan.</li>
        <li>Educate the public on how to recognize the signs of potential imminent landslides.</li>
        <li>Develop a landslide disaster plan.</li>
        <li>Have an emergency preparedness kit ready. </li>
        <li>Keep a list of emergency contact numbers on hand.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>During:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Be prepared to evacuate if there is a warning of an impending landslide.</li>
        <li>Evacuate immediately when unusual sounds indicate signs of a landslide.</li>
        <li>Stay away from landslide areas and watch for debris and falling rocks. Find cover under a sturdy tree or structure.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>After:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stay away from the landslide area until the area is safe, as there could be a risk of additional landslides.</li>
        <li>Tune in to local radio or television stations, and follow local news outlets and emergency officials on social media for further instructions and recent emergency information.</li>
        <li>Ask authorities to thoroughly examine damaged structures and utilities before using them to prevent further hazards and injuries.</li>
        <li>Carefully check and assist neighbors or family members who may be hurt or trapped. Contact the rescuers and let them know the situation.</li>
        <li>Consult a professional for advice on determining the best strategies to prevent or reduce landslide risk.</li>
    </ol>

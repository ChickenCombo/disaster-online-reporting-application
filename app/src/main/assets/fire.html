    <h2>What is a Fire?</h2>
    <p>A fire is when something burns destructively and emits heat, light, flame, and smoke. Fires frequently occur as a result of negligence, irresponsible behavior, or defects in technology or products. Fire generates a black, impenetrable smoke that blocks vision and stings the eyes. It is impossible to navigate through such smoke, so fire drill participants should practice evacuating houses/buildings by at least two routes.</p>

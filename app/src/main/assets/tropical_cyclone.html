    <h2>What is a Tropical Cyclone?</h2>
    <p>An intense low pressure system with minimum sustained winds of 35 kilometers per hour is referred to as a tropical cyclone or "bagyo" (kph).  Strong winds and heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones can result in widespread flooding and flash floods, as well as storm surges, landslides, and mudflows.</p>

    <h2>What is a Tsunami?</h2>
    <p>A tsunami is a series of small to enormous sea waves that can reach heights of more than 5 meters and are frequently caused by undersea earthquakes. They are occasionally confused with storm surges and incorrectly referred to as tidal waves. When the earth is shallowly seated and powerful enough to shift portions of the seabed and disturb the body of water over it, tsunamis can happen.</p>

    <h3>Natural signs of a local tsunami</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Earthquake.</li>
        <li>Unusual changes in sea level occur. The sea level abruptly drops or rises.</li>
        <li>The sound of rumbling waves can be heard.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tsunami safety and preparedness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Following a powerful earthquake, avoid staying in low-lying coastal areas. Get to higher ground right away.</li>
        <li>If unusual sea conditions are seen, such as a rapid lowering of the sea level, head straight for high ground.</li>
        <li>Never go to the shore to keep an eye out for a tsunami. You are too close to the wave to escape once you can see it.</li>
        <li>Interesting sights are frequently made visible during the sudden retreat of the sea level. Fish that have become stranded on land may draw people to collect them. Additionally exposed could be coral flats and sandbars. These sights have a tendency to draw crowds to the shoreline, putting more people at risk.</li>
        <li>Avoid risky areas until a competent authority issues a "all clear" bulletin. A tsunami is a series of waves rather than a single wave.</li>
    </ul>

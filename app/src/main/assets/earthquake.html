    <h2>What is an Earthquake?</h2>
    <p>Earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface, which can range in intensity from a slight trembling to a violent shaking of the ground. Tectonic earthquakes are caused by sudden movement along faults in the earth's solid, rigid layer. Rising magma beneath active volcanoes causes volcanic earthquakes.</p>
    <h3>What to do before, during, and after an Earthquake</h3>
    <h3>Before:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Planning is essential for effective disaster prevention.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Find out if the location is near an active fault and/or is prone to liquefaction or landslides, which could damage your home or other structure.</li>
            <li>When building a house or other structure, make sure that the correct structural design and engineering procedures are followed.</li>
            <li>Check the buildings and important infrastructure's structural soundness; if necessary, strengthen or retrofit as needed.</li>
            <li>In case of an earthquake, prepare in advance with your family. Select a location where you will meet if you become separated.</li>
            <li>Create a preparedness and evacuation plan for family, workplace, and community.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prepare your home and place of employment for the situation.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To stop heavy furniture or cabinets from sliding or toppling, strap them to the wall.</li>
            <li>The lowest shelves should be used to store heavy items and ensure that breakables, hazardous chemicals, and flammable materials are securely fastened.</li>
            <li>Establish the practice of turning off gas tanks when not in use.</li>
            <li>Examine the stability and secure any hanging items, such as chandeliers and ceiling fans, which could come loose and fall during an earthquake.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Get familiarized with your home and place of employment.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn how to use first aid kits, alarms, fire extinguishers, and emergency exits. These ought to be clearly marked, easily reachable, and conveniently located.</li>
            <li>Determine where you can seek refuge during an earthquake, such as close to elevator shafts, close to columns and beams, and close to sturdy tables.</li>
            <li>Prepare and keep a battery-powered radio, flashlight, first aid kit, drinking water, candies, ready-to-eat food, sturdy rope, water-resistant matches, whistle, dust mask, clothes, and blanket in your earthquake survival kit.</li>
            <li>Conduct and take part in regular earthquake drills.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>During:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stay calm.</li>
        <li>If you are in a building that is stable, stay there.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>By staying in the building's stronger areas, such as near to columns and beams, outside the elevator shaft, or by crawling under a sturdy desk or table, you can protect your body from falling debris. Keep in mind to Duck, Cover, and Hold (Duck and Cover under a table, Hold on to the legs)</li>
            <li>Stay away from glass windows and heavy objects like cabinets and shelves</li>
            <li>Watch out for falling objects. Keep your eyes open and be on the lookout.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If you are outside, move to an open area.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay away from power lines, posts, walls, and other potentially unstable structures.</li>
            <li>Avoid structures with glass windows.</li>
            <li>Moving away from steep escarpments that could be affected by landslides is advised if you are on a mountain or close to a steep hill slope.</li>
            <li>When driving a vehicle, pull over to the side of the road and stop your car. Avoid attempting to cross any bridges or overpasses that might have been damaged.</li>
            <li>The safest course of action is to always assume that a tsunami could be triggered if you are close to the shore and experience an earthquake that is strong enough to make standing difficult. Quickly ascend to a higher ground. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>After:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the quickest and safest exit from the building as soon as the shaking stops. Don't make a hasty exit. Get out in a calm and orderly fashion. Bring a disaster supply kit. Use the stairs instead of the elevator. Go to a public space or an area marked for evacuation. Check for injuries on both you and other people.</li>
        <li>Calling family and friends on the phone is not advised unless you require immediate assistance. Authorities in charge of disaster prevention might require the line for urgent communications. Do not use your car and drive away from damaged areas if you must, as rescue and relief efforts depend on roads for mobility.</li>
        <li>Reduce the number of earthquake casualties.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid going inside partially damaged buildings because they might collapse as a result of strong aftershocks.</li>
            <li>Use battery-powered radios to gather information and instructions for disaster prevention.</li>
            <li>Follow the rules regarding public safety.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Check your surroundings.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To prevent any unintentional chain of events, clean up chemical spills as well as toxic and flammable materials.</li>
            <li>Check for fire, and if there is any, put it out.</li>
            <li>If you find any issues with your water or electrical lines, turn off the system using the main valve or switch.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Leave a message indicating where you are going if you must leave your home.</li>
    </ol>
